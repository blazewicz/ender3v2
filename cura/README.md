# Custom Cura configuration

## Custom changes to machine type

Unfortunately Cura allows edits only to a small subset of machine settings. To update my printer profile I've modified
default printer definition for Ender-3. I didn't add a new profile, because my print profiles and configured material
settings would also need to be ported and I didn't feel like doing so.

File `creality_ender3.def.json` should be put in Cura's application files, for macOS it is `~/Library/Application\ Support/cura/5.2/definitions`. Replace `5.2` with your current Cura version.
